        <h1>I Love Chick-fil-a</h1> 

        <!--Paragraph 1-->
        <p>Chick-fil-a is one of the best fast food restaurant ever created. They have 
            the best chicken nuggets and spicy chicken sandwhiches. They also have to 
            best dipping sauces. Chick-fil-a sauce is my faviorte, but Polynesian sauce 
            is a close second. The lemonade is exquiste and it's a great mix between 
            sweet and sour. The milkshakes are always just right and they are the best 
            sweet treats for the summer heat.
        </p>
        <!--Paragraph 2-->
        <p>
            Chick-fil-a has affordable prices. Not only is the lunch menu devine,
            but the breakfast menu is also unbeatable. The customer service is top tier 
            and the employee's are always kind and respectful. There's something on the
            menu for everyone to enjoy. From salads, sandwhiches, or milkshakes,
            you're guaranteed to leave fulfilled and satisfied.
